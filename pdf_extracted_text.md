8. FOR ROOMS WITH SPAN IN EITHER DIRECTION LESS THAN 25', MAIN RUNNERS AND CROSS RUNNERS MAY BE ATTACHED TO THE
PERIMETER OF THE TWO ADJACENT WALLS WITH 3/8" CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE RUNNERS AND THE OTHER TWO WALLS. WHERE SPAN
OF THE CEILING SYSTEM BETWEEN PERIMETER WALLS EXCEED 25' IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, A MINIMUM WALL ANGLE SIZE OF AT LEAST 2"

SEISMIC DESIGN CATEGORIES D,E AND F.
1. SUSPENDED CEILINGS IN SEISMIC DESIGN CATEGORIES D,E, AND F SHALL BE DESIGNED AND INSTALLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASTM
C635, ASTM 636 AND CISCA FOR SEISMIC ZONES 3-4 AS MODIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING:
2. A HEAVY DUTY T-BAR GRID SHALL BE USED
3. THE WIDTH OF THE PERIMETER SUPPORTING CLOSURE ANGLE SHALL BE NOT LESS THAN 2". IN EACH ORTHOGONAL HORIZONTAL
DIRECTION, ONE END OF THE CEILING GRID SHALL BE ATTACHED TO THE CLOSURE ANGLE. THE OTHER END IN EACH HORIZONTAL
DIRECTION SHALL HAVE A 0.75 ". CLEARANCE FROM THE WALL AND SHALL REST UPON AND BE FREE TO SLIDE ON A CLOSURE ANGLE
4. FOR CEILING AREAS EXCEEDING 1,000 SF HORIZONTAL RESTRAINT OF THE CEILING TO THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM SHALL BE PROVIDED. THE
TRIBUTARY AREAS OF THE HORIZONTAL RESTRAINTS SHALL APPROXIMATELY EQUAL
EXCEPTION:
A. RIGID BRACES ARE PERMITTED TO BE USED INSTEAD OF DIAGONAL SPLAY WIRES. BRACES AND ATTACHMENTS TO THE STRUCTURAL
SYSTEM ABOVE SHALL BE ADEQUATE TO LIMIT RELATIVE LATERAL DEFLECTIONS AT POINT OF THE ATTACHMENT OF THE CEILING GRID TO
LESS THAN O.25" FOR THE LOADS PRESCRIBED IN SECTION 13.3.OF MINIMUM DESIGN LOADS FOR BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES
B. FOR CEILING AREAS EXCEEDING 2,500 SF, A SEISMIC SEPARATION JOINT OR FULL HEIGHT PARTITION THAT BREAKS THE CEILING UP INTO
AREAS NOT EXCEEDING 2,500 SF SHALL BE PROVIDED UNLESS STRUCTURAL ANALYSES ARE PERFORMED OF THE CEILING BRACING
SYSTEM FOR THE PRESCRIBED SEISMIC FORCES THAT DEMONSTRATE CEILING SYSTEM PENETRATIONS AND CLOSURE ANGLES PROVIDE
SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE TO ACCOMMODATE THE ANTICIPATED LATERAL DISPLACEMENT
C. EXCEPT WHERE RIGID BRACES ARE USED TO LIMIT LATERAL DEFLECTIONS, SPRINKLER HEADS AND OTHER PENETRATIONS SHALL HAVE A
2" OVERSIZE RING, SLEEVE, OR ADAPTER ROUGH THE CEILING TILE TO ALLOW FOR FREE MOVEMENT OF AT LEAST 1" IN ALL HORIZONTAL
DIRECTIONS. ALTERNATIVELY, A SWING JOINT THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE 1" OF THE CEILING MOVEMENT IN ALL HORIZONTAL
DIRECTIONS IS PERMITTED TO BE PROVIDED AT THE TOP OF THE SPRINKLER HEAD EXTENSION
D. SUSPENDED CEILINGS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SPECIAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS OF ASCE 7-10, SECTION 11A.1.3.9, ITEM 2.
E. AS AN ALTERNATE TO PROVIDING LARGE CLEARANCES AROUND SPRINKLER SYSTEM PENETRATIONS THROUGH CEILING SYSTEMS, THE
SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND CEILING SYSTEM AND CEILING GRID ARE PERMITTED TO BE DESIGNED AND TIED TOGETHER AS AN INTEGRAL
