# Title Extraction Fix - Test Plan

## üéØ The Issue

**Section 11B-206** currently has the wrong title in `cbc_2025.json`:

```json
{
  "number": "11B-206",
  "title": "Alterations to individual residential dwelling units"  ‚ùå WRONG
}
```

According to the HTML `data-section-title` attribute, it should be:

```json
{
  "number": "11B-206",
  "title": "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"  ‚úÖ CORRECT
}
```

## üîß The Fix (Already Implemented!)

The improved title extraction code in `scripts/cbc.py` (lines 245-262) now:

1. **First priority**: Checks `data-section-title` attribute
   ```html
   <div
     class="section-action-wrapper"
     data-section-title="SECTION 11B-206 ‚Äî ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"
   ></div>
   ```
2. **Second priority**: Falls back to `span.level_title` element

3. **Last resort**: Parses raw header text

The `extract_title()` function (lines 208-221) then:

- Splits on "‚Äî" separator
- Returns "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES" (the part after "11B-206 ‚Äî")

## ‚úÖ Code Review

```python
# Lines 245-262 in scripts/cbc.py
section_title = None

# 1. Try data-section-title attribute (NEW - MOST RELIABLE)
if header_elem.get("data-section-title"):
    section_title_raw = header_elem.get("data-section-title")
    section_title = extract_title(section_title_raw, section_number)

# 2. Try span with level class
if not section_title:
    title_elem = level_section.find("span", class_=re.compile(r"level\d_title"))
    if title_elem:
        section_title = title_elem.get_text().strip()

# 3. Fallback to parsing header text
if not section_title:
    section_title = extract_title(header_text, section_number)
```

**Status: ‚úÖ Code is correct and ready to test**

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Prerequisites

1. Refresh AWS credentials:

   ```bash
   aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
   ```

2. Activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/will/code/service
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Step 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)

```bash
# Test with --test flag (only processes a few sections)
python scripts/cbc.py --version 2025 --test --compare --dry-run
```

**Expected output:**

```
üìù Values Changed: X
  root['sections'][N]['title']
    OLD: Alterations to individual residential dwelling units
    NEW: ACCESSIBLE ROUTES
```

### Step 2: Full Run with Comparison

```bash
# Full extraction with comparison
python scripts/cbc.py --version 2025 --compare
```

This will:

- ‚úÖ Generate `cbc_2025_new.json` with corrected titles
- ‚úÖ Compare with `cbc_2025.json` baseline
- ‚úÖ Show all title changes in terminal
- ‚úÖ Save detailed diff to `diff_report.json`
- ‚úÖ Prevent S3 upload (safety feature)

### Step 3: Review the Changes

```bash
# See all title changes
cat diff_report.json | jq '.values_changed | to_entries | .[] | select(.key | contains("title"))'

# Count title changes
cat diff_report.json | jq '.values_changed | to_entries | .[] | select(.key | contains("title")) | .key' | wc -l

# Check specific section
cat cbc_2025_new.json | jq '.sections[] | select(.number == "11B-206") | {number, title}'
```

**Expected:**

```json
{
  "number": "11B-206",
  "title": "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"
}
```

### Step 4: Accept Changes

If the changes look correct:

```bash
# Replace baseline with corrected version
mv cbc_2025_new.json cbc_2025.json

# Verify
cat cbc_2025.json | jq '.sections[] | select(.number == "11B-206") | .title'
# Should output: "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"
```

### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
# Upload to S3
python scripts/cbc.py --version 2025
```

## üìä What to Expect

### Likely Changes

The fix will probably correct titles for multiple sections, not just 11B-206:

- **Chapter 10 sections**: May have cleaner titles
- **Chapter 11A sections**: Should be more accurate
- **Chapter 11B sections**: Major improvements expected

### How Many Changes?

Based on the code logic, expect:

- **10-50 section titles** corrected (out of ~200 total sections)
- **Minimal subsection changes** (subsections use different extraction logic)
- **No other data changes** (only titles affected)

### Red Flags to Watch For

‚ùå **Bad**: If you see NEW titles that are:

- Empty or just whitespace
- Contain HTML tags
- Are obviously wrong (e.g., "Exception" as a section title)

‚úÖ **Good**: If you see titles that:

- Match the official ICC section titles
- Are concise and clear
- Make sense in context

## üîç Manual Verification

You can verify specific sections by checking the ICC website:

1. Go to: https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/CABC2025P1
2. Navigate to Chapter 11B
3. Find Section 11B-206
4. Confirm the title is "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"

## üìù Commit Message Template

After accepting changes:

```bash
git add scripts/cbc.py cbc_2025.json
git commit -m "Fix: Improve section title extraction using data-section-title attribute

- Prioritize data-section-title attribute over text parsing
- Fixes incorrect titles (e.g., 11B-206 now 'ACCESSIBLE ROUTES')
- More reliable extraction for sections with complex HTML structure
- Tested with comparison system, verified X titles corrected
- No impact on subsections or other data

Refs: #<issue-number> (if applicable)"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No changes detected

**Possible causes:**

1. The baseline already has correct titles (unexpected, but verify manually)
2. S3 HTML files haven't been updated
3. The section numbers don't match the regex patterns

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check a few sections manually
cat cbc_2025.json | jq '.sections[] | select(.number | startswith("11B-")) | {number, title}' | head -20
```

### Issue: Too many changes

**Possible causes:**

1. Baseline was generated with very old code
2. This is actually expected if many titles were wrong

**Solution:**

- Review a sample of changes manually
- Verify against ICC website
- If uncertain, test with `--test` flag first

### Issue: Some titles look wrong in new output

**Possible causes:**

1. data-section-title attribute itself has wrong data (rare)
2. extract_title() function needs adjustment

**Solution:**

```bash
# Don't accept the changes
rm cbc_2025_new.json diff_report.json

# Investigate the HTML structure
# Adjust the code if needed
```

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Section 11B-206 title changes from "Alterations..." to "ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"
‚úÖ Other section titles improve or stay the same
‚úÖ No data lost (subsections, paragraphs, tables, figures all intact)
‚úÖ Total section count unchanged
‚úÖ Comparison system detects and reports all changes clearly
