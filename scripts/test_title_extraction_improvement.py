The improved extraction now prioritizes data-section-title attribute:

1. ‚úÖ Try data-section-title attribute (MOST RELIABLE)
   - Contains clean section title directly from ICC data
   - Example: "SECTION 11B-206 ‚Äî ACCESSIBLE ROUTES"
   
2. ‚úÖ Try span.level_title element (BACKUP)
   - Used if attribute is missing
   
3. ‚úÖ Parse header text (LAST RESORT)
   - Only used if both above fail
   - Previously this was option #2 (too eager!)

Result: More accurate titles, especially for sections with complex HTML structure.
